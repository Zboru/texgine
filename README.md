# texGine

texGine is a side project that aims to make it easy to create text-based games. The game looks like the user is solving
a quiz. The game is based on successive steps, and the player is supposed to choose one of the available options in a
given step. You can create a game and have other players play it through a list of public games, or share it privately with
friends.

Currently, the project is in the early stages of development and does not include a working game creator. At the moment
work is directed at the interface.
